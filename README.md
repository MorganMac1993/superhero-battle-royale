## Project Description

Ever wondered which superhero, in an all out battle royale, would come out on top? Look no further than this full-stack MERN app!

Create or choose a superhero, select an opponent, then pit the two against one another to see which is stronger in battle. This app uses a ExpressJS as a homemade API that includes many well known superheros, and handles our backend routing and functionality.
